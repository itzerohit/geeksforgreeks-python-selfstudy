Given three positive integers a, b and c. Your task is to perform some bitwise operations on them as given below:
1. d = a ^ a
2. e = c ^ b
3. f = a & b
4. g = c | (a ^ a)
5. e = ~ e
Note: ^ is for xor.
Then print d e f g space seperately. Move the cursor to the next line after printing.

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0 -2 0 3
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.
Input: a = 4 , b = 5 , c = 6
Output: 0 -4 4 6
Explanation: We print d e f g after performing the given operations.

Ans -- 
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
#code here
#Do a^a below
d=a^a
#Do c^b below
e=c^b
#Do a&b below
f=a&b
#Do c|(a^a) below
g=c|(a^a)
#Do ~e below
e = ~e
print(d, e, f, g)
